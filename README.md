# Portfolio
Fictional e-commerce website for a watch store called MK TIME. It is coded in HTML and uses Bootstrap 5 and some custom CSS for styling.

The website is live [here](https://codespace-portfolio.onrender.com/).

Some features still need to be implemented:

- [x] A `products` page that lists all products.
- [ ] A `product` page with the detail of each single product.
- [ ] A `clearance` page that lists the products on sale.

The links in the footer are just dummy links and at the moment I am not planning to implement the corresponding pages.
